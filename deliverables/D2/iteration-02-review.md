## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

- Where: Online on Discord

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. What worked well

1. **Consistent weekly stand-up meetings:**
   We scheduled a 30-minute stand-up every Sunday to check in on progress and align tasks for the upcoming week. These meetings helped maintain momentum, fostered accountability, and provided a space to resolve blockers early. They also strengthened our sense of team commitment and collaboration.

2. **Following proper GitHub etiquette and workflow:**
   After the initial adjustment period, the team consistently followed best practices: working on feature branches, writing clear commit messages, opening pull requests for review, and only merging after approvals. This minimized merge conflicts, improved traceability, and reinforced a culture of accountability in our development process.

3. **Efficient communication with our partner:**
   Our partner liaison played a central role in organizing and forwarding our questions, ensuring external communication remained clear and timely. As a result, our partner responded promptly, and we were able to incorporate feedback without delays or confusion.

#### Q2. What did not work well

1. **Unclear deadlines and shifting timelines:**
   Our task deadlines were often informally discussed and sometimes revised mid-sprint, which created uncertainty about when deliverables were actually due. This occasionally led to last-minute work on certain features while others remained unfinished or idle. To improve, we suggest locking task deadlines in a shared calendar and only changing them through team consensus. This would help us better pace our work and reduce last-minute stress.

2. **Weekly goals and task assignments weren’t tracked in a visible place:**
   While we followed proper GitHub workflow, we didn’t have a shared space to outline weekly goals or track individual task assignments. As a result, it wasn’t always clear who was working on what, or which tasks were done. Using a shared task board (e.g., Trello, Notion, or GitHub Projects) where everyone can update their progress and cross off completed items would keep the team aligned and make it easier to stay on track between meetings.

3. **Team communication could have been more consistent:**
   There were periods of low activity in our Discord chat, which made it difficult to track individual progress between meetings. Posting more frequent updates—such as questions, coding challenges, or when a task is completed—would help maintain transparency and ensure everyone stays informed and connected throughout the sprint.

#### Q3(a). Planned changes

1. **Shifting more team members to backend development:**
   As our partner has indicated that the current frontend meets their expectations, we plan to reassign some of our frontend-focused developers to the backend team. This will allow us to speed up work on essential backend features such as authentication, database integration, and API endpoints. By redistributing resources, we aim to stay on track for backend–frontend integration milestones and ensure that core functionality is ready for testing and delivery.

2. **Improving coordination between frontend and backend teams:**
   To avoid misalignment and reduce integration issues, we will improve how the frontend and backend teams communicate. Specifically, we will start using our Jira board more actively to outline task ownership, track weekly goals, and update progress status in real time. In addition, we will encourage more frequent and responsive communication in Discord, especially when a task is ready for handoff or blocked due to dependency. This will help us catch mismatches early and keep both sides moving in sync.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps

The backend team, including full-stack developers, was split between implementing authentication logic (sign-up/login) and building n8n workflows. On the frontend, each member was responsible for 1–2 static pages (e.g., landing, sign-in, dashboard, calendar, automation). Integration was guided by a clear set of requirements defined by the frontend team, which helped streamline backend–frontend alignment. Backend connections to these pages are currently in progress.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

Since our backend integration is still in progress, the version of the website we deployed for the demo consisted of static webpages. These pages closely resembled our original Figma designs but with some visual improvements. Our partner reviewed the UI and approved the overall look and structure without requesting additional styling changes. However, he emphasized the importance of getting the core functionality working as soon as possible and advised us to shift our focus to backend integration. From this experience, we learned that while visual polish is appreciated, functional progress is a higher priority at this stage. We now understand the need to prioritize backend development and are planning to reassign more team members to backend tasks to accelerate progress and ensure core features are up and running soon.
